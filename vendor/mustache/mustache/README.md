## Installation

```
composer require mustache/mustache
```

## Usage

A quick example:

```php
<?php
$m = new \Mustache\Engine(['entity_flags' => ENT_QUOTES]);
echo $m->render('Hello {{planet}}', ['planet' => 'World!']); // "Hello World!"
```


And a more in-depth example -- this is the canonical Mustache template:

```html+jinja
Hello {{name}}
You have just won {{value}} dollars!
{{#in_ca}}
Well, {{taxed_value}} dollars, after taxes.
{{/in_ca}}
```


Create a view "context" object -- which could also be an associative array, but those don't do functions quite as well:

```php
<?php
class Chris {
    public $name  = "Chris";
    public $value = 10000;

    public function taxed_value() {
        return $this->value - ($this->value * 0.4);
    }

    public $in_ca = true;
}
```


And render it:

```php
<?php
$m = new \Mustache\Engine(['entity_flags' => ENT_QUOTES]);
$chris = new \Chris;
echo $m->render($template, $chris);
```

*Note:* we recommend using `ENT_QUOTES` as a default of [entity_flags][entity_flags] to decrease the chance of Cross-site scripting vulnerability.


## And That's Not All!

Read [the Mustache.php documentation][docs] for more information.


## Upgrading from v2.x
_Mustache.php v3.x drops support for PHP 5.2â€“5.5_, but is otherwise backwards compatible with v2.x.

To ease the transition, previous behavior can be preserved via configuration:

 - The `strict_callables` config option now defaults to `true`. Lambda sections should use closures or callable objects. To continue supporting array-style callables for lambda sections (e.g. `[$this, 'foo']`), set `strict_callables` to `false`.
 - [A context shadowing bug from v2.x has been fixed](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php/commit/66ecb327ce15b9efa0cfcb7026fdc62c6659b27f), but if you depend on the previous buggy behavior you can preserve it via the `buggy_property_shadowing` config option.
 - By default the return value of higher-order sections that are rendered via the lambda helper will no longer be double-rendered. To preserve the previous behavior, set `double_render_lambdas` to `true`. _This is not recommended._

In order to maintain a wide PHP version support range, there are minor changes to a few interfaces, which you might need to handle if you extend Mustache (see [c0453be](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php/commit/c0453be5c09e7d988b396982e29218fcb25b7304)).
